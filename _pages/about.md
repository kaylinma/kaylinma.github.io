Hello everyone! My name is Linwei Ma. I'm a first year PhD student in Consumer Behavior and Family Economics Program at University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include consumer decison-making, behavioral economics and cultural values. My background in behavioral economics, cultural studies and disparities in labor market intersect seamlessly with the programâ€™s multidisciplinary approach. I am eager to contribute to the program's focus on consumer well-being and policy- making, utilizing my skills in quantitative analysis and my experience in applied research.
